COM S 327 Project 1

Use command "make" to compile Makefile.

If there are something wrong about Makefile,
please try to edit Makefile by deleting the spaces in front of the commands and typing a TAB.
Sometime this happened to me when I git push code to Gitlab.

This project utilizes digital sound processing techniques to perform various tasks on small sound samples.
Some formulas and algorithms need to be translated into C programming source code and working procedures.

Part a: (285/300)
     Generates wav by using float numbers and generate float numbers at a specified frequency, a specified sample rate, and a specified time duration.
     Dials a number with some silence at specified sample rate during a specified duration.

Part b: (264/300)
     This part focus more on some knowledge points in terms of FILE and pointer in C.
     This part reorganizes the architecture of Part a so that sounds can be returned from functions.
     some of the code in Part a was reused, like calculating the float numbers which keypad generates.

Part c:
     This assignment reorganizes the architecture of Part a so that sounds can be returned from functions.
     much of the code in part b was reused; implement Square, WawTooth, Triangle based on genSine.
