# Computer Science 327Project 2, Part a C++ Programming Project Digital SoundCont.
  
The second project for Coms 327 Fall 2020.

Use command "make" to compile Makefile.
If there are something wrong about Makefile,
please try to edit Makefile by deleting the spaces in front of the commands and typing a TAB.
Sometime this happened to me when I git push code to Gitlab.

-------------------------------------------PART A-------------------------------------------

Same like Project 1, use command./main to compile the project, outputing the float numbers
which can generate the sine waves, square waves, triangle waves, and sawtooth waves.


-------------------------------------------PART B-------------------------------------------

Implemented two more functions in SoundSamples:reverb2() & adsr(),
and TestMain.cpp to ask inputs and generate samples in the file.
Executable file: main
It asks user to input key of piano, output file name, the parameters of reverb2() and adsr()
